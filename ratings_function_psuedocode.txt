def ratings:
    loop thru every play:
        - update current period/lineup
        - see if in middle of free throw sequence (free_throw function)
            note: might have to change this to indicate if the free throw sequence has STARTED
                    then when (end_of_possession function) evaluates to TRUE, then it indicates that the free throw sequence has ended
                    which we will then use to set our subLineup = currentLineup
        - (substition function) elaborated upon below...
            - substitute players in and out
            - accounts for the substitutions during free throws
        - check (end_of_possession function)
            - T/F flag to see if it's the end of a possession
            - pt value to be added/subtracted
        - go thru each player and add/sub pts for their plus/minus
            - potentially make this a function?
            note: always add/sub pts for plus/minus of players for currentLineup property ONLY
            note: add/sub action to be done here outside of substitution function


NOTE: potentially have 2 flags start/end of free throw sequence
      reset start and end flags when end flag gets set to True
input: play, whether or not in middle of free throw sequence
output: none, it will substitute players
def substition:
    - make sure it's a substition play

    Decision Tree:
    - not free throw sequence
        - substitute players into currentLineup
    - start of free throw sequence
        - set subLineup = currentLineup
        - substitute players into subLineup
    - end of free throw sequence
        - substitute players into subLineup
        - set currentLineup = subLineup
